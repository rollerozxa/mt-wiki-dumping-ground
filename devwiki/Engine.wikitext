The engine section and the [[:Category:Core_Engine|Core Engine category]] is for documentation of the Minetest engine, which consists of a C++ core and a Lua builtin script.

This page contains links to useful information.

== Useful Resources ==

* [[Engine/Structure|Engine Structure]] - for an introduction and light reference to the engine's structure. Start here.
* [[Engine/Basic_data_structures|Basic data structures]] - general data structures.
* [[Engine/Objects|Objects]] - documentation on active and static objects.
* Doxygen - For a complete (but often missing comments) reference to code. You'll need to generate this yourself
* See [[:Category:Core_Engine|all pages on the engine]].
* See [[:Category:Rules_and_Guidelines|Rules and Guidelines]].

== How to help improve documentation ==

* Doxygen: We want to document most or all of Minetest core with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen Doxygen-style] code comments.
:* The usage of doxygen is explained [http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/index.html there].
:* Head over to #minetest-dev on IRC, and ask someone there to help you get started with documentation. You'll need to download the project through [[Git]] and then make your changes.
* Move stuff from [[Engine/NMPR|NMPR]] to [[Engine/Structure|Engine Structure]], and improve [[Engine/Structure|Engine Structure]] generally.
