The profiler graphs show the performance of Minetest in a more detailed fashion. This information is useful for engine developers. The profiler graphs are shown when you hit the debug key (<kbd>F5</kbd> by default) twice.

The following graphs are available:

* '''rudp_rtt''': ???
* '''rudp_jitter''': ???
* '''packets_lost''': ???
* '''num_processed_meshes''': The engine generates geometric meshes from MapBlock data for drawing. This is the number of those meshes that finished generating in each frame.
* '''mainloop_sleep''': If the game runs at a faster rate than <code>wanted_fps</code>, a sleep is inserted into each frame after drawing in order to not consume excess resources; this is that sleep time in seconds.
* '''mainloop_other''': Time (in seconds) spent in each frame for everything else than drawing.
* '''mainloop_dtime''': Total time (in seconds) spent per frame (<code>mainloop_other + mainloop_draw + mainloop_sleep</code>); FPS = 1 divided by this, averaged.
* '''mainloop_draw''': Time (in seconds) spent in each frame for drawing (rendering).
* '''client_received_packets''': Number of received high-level protocol packets in each frame.
