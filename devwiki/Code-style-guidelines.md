This is the coding style used for C/C++ code. Also see the [Lua code style guidelines](Lua_code_style_guidelines "wikilink").

The coding style is based on the [Linux kernel code style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html). Much of the existing code doesn\'t follow the current code style guidelines, do not try to replicate that. Use your best judgment for C++-specific syntax.

Currently, the code uses C++14. Do not use features that depend on more recent versions.

### Spelling

Use American English, but avoid idioms that may be difficult to understand by non-native speakers.

### Function declarations {#function_declarations}

In case your function parameters don\'t fit within the defined line length, use the following style. Indention for continuation lines is **exactly** two tabs.

``` cpp
void some_function_name(type1 param1, type2 param2, type3 param3,
        type4 param4, type5 param5, type6 param6, type7 param7)
{
    ...
}
```

Sometimes with complex function declarations, it might be messy to define as many parameters as possible on the same line. This is acceptable too (and currently used in some places):

``` cpp
void some_function_name(
        const ReallyBigLongTypeName &param1,
        ReallyBigLongTypeName *param2,
        void *param3,
        size_t param4,
        const void *param5,
        size_t param6)
{
    ...
}
```

No more than 7 parameters allowed (except for constructors).

### Spaces

-   `<span style="color: red">`{=html}Do **not** use spaces to indent.`</span>`{=html}
-   Try to stay under 6 levels of indentation.
-   Add spaces between operators so they line up when appropriate (don\'t go overboard). For example:

``` cpp
np_terrain_base   = settings->getNoiseParams("mgv6_np_terrain_base");
np_terrain_higher = settings->getNoiseParams("mgv6_np_terrain_higher");
np_steepness      = settings->getNoiseParams("mgv6_np_steepness");
np_height_select  = settings->getNoiseParams("mgv6_np_height_select");
...
bool success =
        np_terrain_base  && np_terrain_higher && np_steepness &&
        np_height_select && np_trees          && np_mud       &&
        np_beach         && np_biome          && np_cave;
```

The above code looks really nice.

-   Separate different parts of functions with newlines for readability.
-   Separate functions by two newlines (not necessary, but encouraged).
-   Use a space after `if`, `else`, `for`, `do`, `while`, `switch`, `case`, `try`, `catch`, etc.
-   When breaking conditionals, indent following lines of the conditional with two tabs and the statement body with one tab. For example:

``` cpp
for (std::vector<std::string>::iterator it = strings.begin();
        it != strings.end();
        ++it) {
    *it = it->substr(1, 1);
}
```

-   Align backslashes for multi-line macros with spaces:

``` cpp
#define FOOBAR(x) do {    \
    int __temp = (x); \
    foo(__temp);      \
} while (0)
```

### Bracing and indentation {#bracing_and_indentation}

#### `if` statements {#if_statements}

This rule has already been explicitly stated in the [Linux kernel code style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html) from which this code style inherits, but it will be repeated here:

`<span style="color: red">`{=html}**Putting the body of an `if` statement on the same line as the condition is strictly prohibited.**`</span>`{=html}

Example:

``` cpp
if (foobar < 3) foobar = 45;      // Bad 
(foobar < 3 && (foobar = 45));    // Bad
```

Violating this rule will result in **instant rejection**.

Examples of good if statement wordings:

``` cpp
if (foobar < 3)
    foobar = 45;

if (foobar < 6) {
    foobar = 62;
    return;
}
```

#### Nested for loop exception {#nested_for_loop_exception}

Special exception to the standard bracing/indent rules for nested loops: If a nested loop iterates over a set of coordinates, it is permitted to omit the braces for all but the innermost loop and keep the outer loops at the same indentation level, like so:

``` cpp
for (s16 z = pmin.Z; z <= pmax.Z, z++)
for (s16 y = pmin.Y; y <= pmax.Y; y++)
for (s16 x = pmin.X; x <= pmax.X; x++) {
    // ... do stuff here ...
}
```

### Do not be too C++y {#do_not_be_too_cy}

-   Avoid passing non-`const` references to functions.
-   Don\'t use initializer lists unless absolutely necessary (initializing an object inside a class, or initializing a reference).
-   Try to minimize the use of exceptions.
-   Avoid operator overloading like the plague.
-   Avoid templates unless they are very convenient.
-   Usage of macros is not discouraged, just don\'t overdo it [like X.org](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/tree/randr/rrscreen.c?id=01e18af17f8dc91451fbd0902049045afd1cea7e#n325). It\'s better to use inline functions or lambdas instead.

### Classes

-   **Class names are *PascalCase*, method names are *camelCase*.**
-   Don\'t put actual code in header files, unless it\'s a 4-liner, an inline function, or part of a template.
-   Class definitions should go in header files.
-   Substantial methods (over 4 lines) should be defined outside of the class definition.
-   Functions not part of any class should use `lowercase_underscore_style()`.

### Comments

-   Doxygen comments are acceptable, but **please** put them in the header file.
-   Don\'t make uninformative comments like this:

``` cpp
// Draw "Loading" screen
draw_load_screen(L"Loading...", driver, font);
```

-   Add comments to explain a non-trivial but important detail about the code, or explain behavior that is not obvious.
-   For comments with text, be sure to add a space between the text and the comment tokens:

``` cpp
DoThingHere();  // This does thing    <--- yes!
DoThingHere();  /* This does thing */ <--- yes!

DoThingHere();  //This does thing      <--- no!
DoThingHere();  /*This does thing*/    <--- no!
DoThingHere();//This does thing        <--- no!
```

### Use STL, avoid Irrlicht containers, and no, Boost will not even be considered, so forget it {#use_stl_avoid_irrlicht_containers_and_no_boost_will_not_even_be_considered_so_forget_it}

-   In general, adding new dependencies is considered serious business.
-   We are using C++14; Boost will never be an option.

### Don\'t let things get too large {#dont_let_things_get_too_large}

-   **Try to keep lines under 95 characters.** It\'s okay if it goes over by a few, but do not exaggerate. (Note that this column count assumes 4-space indents.)
-   Functions should not have over 200 lines of code -- if you are concerned with having to pass too many parameters to child functions, make whatever it is into a class.
-   Don\'t let files get too large (over 1500 lines of code). Currently, existing huge files (`game.cpp`, `server.cpp`, ...) are in the slow process of being cleaned up.

### Files

-   Files should be named using *snake_case* style.
-   Files should have includes for everything that they depend on. Don\'t depend on, eg, `"util/numeric.h"` including `<string>`{=html}!
-   Uniqueness when compiling headers is ensured by using `#pragma once`. ([Accepted by all coredevs](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/issues/6259))

``` cpp
#pragma once

#include <string>

class Foo {
};
```

-   All files should include the appropriate license header.

### Miscellaneous

-   `<span style="color: red">`{=html}Do **not** use `or`, use `||`.`</span>`{=html}
-   Set pointer values to `nullptr` (C++11), not 0.
-   When using floats, add the `f` suffix, e.g. `float k = 0.0f;` and not `float k = 0.0;`.
-   Avoid non-ASCII characters in source files. Other UTF-8 characters may (only) be used in string literals and comments where ASCII would worsen readability.
-   Use of Hungarian notation is very limited. Scope specifiers such as `g_` for globals, `s_` for statics, or `m_` for members are allowed. The prefix `m_` is discouraged for public members in newer code as it is a part of the class\' interface, but sometimes needed for consistency when adding a member to older code.
-   Use *snake_case* for local variables, not *camelCase*.
-   Don\'t use distracting and unnecessary amounts of object-oriented abstraction. See [Terasology](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology) as an example of what not to do.
    -   Don\'t add unnecessary design patterns to your code, such as factories/providers/sources.
-   In `switch-case` statements, add `break` to the last case and to the `default` case.
-   In `if-else` statements, put the code which is more likely to be executed first.
-   For consistency, use American English where spellings differ (e.g. use \"color\", not \"colour\").
