The engine section and the [Core Engine category](:Category:Core_Engine "wikilink") is for documentation of the Minetest engine, which consists of a C++ core and a Lua builtin script.

This page contains links to useful information.

## Useful Resources {#useful_resources}

-   [Engine Structure](Engine/Structure "wikilink") - for an introduction and light reference to the engine\'s structure. Start here.
-   [Basic data structures](Engine/Basic_data_structures "wikilink") - general data structures.
-   [Objects](Engine/Objects "wikilink") - documentation on active and static objects.
-   Doxygen - For a complete (but often missing comments) reference to code. You\'ll need to generate this yourself
-   See [all pages on the engine](:Category:Core_Engine "wikilink").
-   See [Rules and Guidelines](:Category:Rules_and_Guidelines "wikilink").

## How to help improve documentation {#how_to_help_improve_documentation}

-   Doxygen: We want to document most or all of Minetest core with [Doxygen-style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen) code comments.

:\* The usage of doxygen is explained [there](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/index.html).

:\* Head over to #minetest-dev on IRC, and ask someone there to help you get started with documentation. You\'ll need to download the project through [Git](Git "wikilink") and then make your changes.

-   Move stuff from [NMPR](Engine/NMPR "wikilink") to [Engine Structure](Engine/Structure "wikilink"), and improve [Engine Structure](Engine/Structure "wikilink") generally.
