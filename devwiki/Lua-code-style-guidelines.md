This is largely based on [the Python style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) except for some indentation and language syntax differences. When in doubt, consult that guide.

Note that these are only *guidelines* for more readable code. In some (rare) cases they may result in *less* readable code. Use your best judgement.

## Comments

-   Incorrect or outdated comments are worse than no comments.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Avoid inline comments, unless they\'re very short.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Write comments to clarify anything that may be confusing. Don\'t write comments that describe things that are obvious from the code.

`<span style="color: #282;">`{=html}Good:`</span>`{=html}

``` Lua
width = width - 2  -- Adjust for 1px border on each side
```

`<span style="color: #b44;">`{=html}Bad:`</span>`{=html}

``` Lua
width = width - 2  -- Decrement width by two
```

-   Comments should follow English grammar rules, this means **starting with a capital letter**, using commas and apostrophes where appropriate, and **ending with a period**. The period may be omitted in single-sentence comments. If the first word of a comment is an identifier, its casing should not be changed. **Check the spelling.**

``` Lua
-- This is a properly formatted comment.
-- This isnt.              (missing apostrophe)
-- neither is this.        (lowercase first letter)
```

-   Comments should have a space between the comment characters and the first word.

``` Lua
--This is wrong.
-- This is right.
```

-   Inline comments should be separated from the code by two spaces.

``` Lua
foo()  -- A proper comment.
```

-   If you write comments for a documentation generation tool, write the comments in LuaDoc format.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Short multi-line comments should use the regular single-line comment style.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Long multi-line comments should use Lua\'s multi-line comment format with no leading characters except a `--` before the closer.

``` Lua
--[[
Very long
multi-line comment.
--]]
```

## Lines, spaces, and indentation {#lines_spaces_and_indentation}

-   Indentation is done with one tab per indentation level.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Lines are wrapped at 80 characters** where possible, with a hard limit of 90. If you need more you\'re probably doing something wrong.

### Continuation lines {#continuation_lines}

-   Conditional expressions have continuation lines indented by two tabs.

``` Lua
if long_function_call(with, many, arguments) and
        another_function_call() then
    do_something()
end
```

\
\* Function arguments are indented by two tabs if multiple arguments are in a line, same for definition continuations.

``` Lua
foo(bar, biz, "This is a long string..."
        baz, qux, "Lua")

function foo(a, b, c, d,
        e, f, g, h)
    [â€¦]
end
```

\
\* If the function arguments contain a table, it\'s indented by one tab and if the arguments get own lines, it\'s indented like a table.

``` Lua
register_node("name", {
    "This is a long string...",
    0.3,
})

list = filterlist.create(
    preparemodlist,
    comparemod,
    function()
        return "no comma at the end"
    end
)
```

\
\* When strings don\'t fit into the line, you should add the string (changes) to the next line(s) indented by one tab.

``` Lua
longvarname = longvarname ..
    "Thanks for reading this example!"

local retval =
    "size[11.5,7.5,true]" ..
    "label[0.5,0;" .. fgettext("World:") .. "]" ..
    "label[1.75,0;" .. data.worldspec.name .. "]"
```

\
\* When breaking around a binary operator you should break after the operator.

``` Lua
if a or b or c or d or
        e or f then
    foo()
end
```

\

### Empty lines {#empty_lines}

-   Use a single empty line to separate sections of long functions.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Use two empty lines to separate top-level functions and large tables.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Do not use a empty line after conditional, looping, or function opening statements.

`<span style="color: #282;">`{=html}Good:`</span>`{=html}

``` Lua
function foo()
    if x then
        bar()
    end
end
```

`<span style="color: #b44;">`{=html}Bad:`</span>`{=html}

``` Lua
function foo()

    if x then

        bar()
    end
end
```

-   Don\'t leave white-space at the end of lines.

### Spaces

-   Spaces are not used around parenthesis, brackets, or curly braces.

`<span style="color: #282;">`{=html}Good:`</span>`{=html}

``` Lua
foo({baz=true})
bar[1] = "Hello world"
```

`<span style="color: #b44;">`{=html}Bad:`</span>`{=html}

``` Lua
foo ( { baz=true } )
bar [ 1 ]
```

-   Spaces are used after, but not before, commas and semicolons.

`<span style="color: #282;">`{=html}Good:`</span>`{=html}

``` Lua
foo(a, b, {c, d})
```

`<span style="color: #b44;">`{=html}Bad:`</span>`{=html}

``` Lua
foo(a,b,{c , d})
```

-   Spaces are used around binary operators with following exceptions:
    -   There mustn\'t be spaces around the member access operator (\".\")
    -   Spaces around the concatenation operator (\"..\") are optional.
    -   In short one-line table definitions the spaces around the equals sign can be omitted.
    -   When in-/decrementing a variable by 1, the spaces around the + and - operator can be omitted if you want to \"get the neighbour\" of something, e.g. when increasing some counter variable.

`<span style="color: #282;">`{=html}Good:`</span>`{=html}

``` Lua
local num = 2 * (3 / 4)
foo({bar=true})
foo({bar = true})
local def = {
    foo = true,
    bar = false,
}
i = i+1
sometable[#sometable+1] = v
```

`<span style="color: #b44;">`{=html}Bad:`</span>`{=html}

``` Lua
local num=2*(3/4)
local def={
    foo=true,
    bar=false,
}
playerpos.y = playerpos.y+1  -- playerpos.y is not an integer
```

-   Use spaces to align related things, but don\'t go overboard:

`<span style="color: #282;">`{=html}Good:`</span>`{=html}

``` Lua
local node_up   = minetest.get_node(pos_up)
local node_down = minetest.get_node(pos_down)
-- Too long relative to the other lines, don't align with it
local node_up_1_east_2_north_3 = minetest.get_node(pos_up_1_east_2_north_3)
```

`<span style="color: #b44;">`{=html}Bad:`</span>`{=html}

``` Lua
local x                       = true
local very_long_variable_name = false

local foobar    = true
local unrelated = {}
```

### Tables

-   **Small tables may be placed on one line.** Large tables have one entry per line, with the opening and closing braces on lines without items; and with a comma after the last item.

`<span style="color: #282;">`{=html}Good:`</span>`{=html}

``` Lua
local foo = {bar=true}
foo = {
    bar = 0,
    biz = 1,
    baz = 2,
}
```

`<span style="color: #b44;">`{=html}Bad:`</span>`{=html}

``` Lua
foo = {bar = 0,
    biz = 1,
    baz = 2}
foo = {
    bar = 0, biz = 1,
    baz = 2
}
```

-   In list-style tables where each element is short multiple elements may be placed on each line.

``` Lua
local first_eight_letters = {
    "a", "b", "c", "d",
    "e", "f", "g", "h",
}
```

## Naming

-   **Functions and variables should be named in `lowercase_underscore_style`**, with the exception of constructor-like functions such as `PseudoRandom()`, which should use UpperCamelCase.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Don\'t invent compound words. Common words like `filename` are okay, but mashes like `getbox` and `collisiondetection` aren\'t.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Avoid leading and/or trailing underscores. They\'re ugly and can be hard to see.

## Misc

-   Don\'t put multiple statements on the same line.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   You can put conditionals / loops with small conditions and bodies on one line. This is discouraged for all but the smallest ones though.

`<span style="color: #282;">`{=html}Good:`</span>`{=html}

``` Lua
local f, err = io.open(filename, "r")
if not f then return err end

if     foo then return foo
elseif bar then return bar
elseif qux then return qux
end
```

`<span style="color: #b44;">`{=html}Bad:`</span>`{=html}

``` Lua
if not f and use_error then error(err) elseif not f then return err end
```

-   Don\'t compare values explicitly to `true`, `false`, or `nil`, unless it\'s really needed.

`<span style="color: #282;">`{=html}Good:`</span>`{=html}

``` Lua
local f, err = io.open(filename, "r")
if not f then return err end

local t = {"a", true, false}
for i = 1, 5 do
    -- Needs an explicit nil check to avoid triggering
    -- on false, which is a valid value.
    if t[i] == nil then
        t[i] = "Default"
    end
end
```

`<span style="color: #b44;">`{=html}Bad:`</span>`{=html}

``` Lua
if f == nil then return err end
```

-   Don\'t use unnecessary parenthesis unless they improve readability a lot.

``` Lua
if y then bar() end -- Good
if (not x) then foo() end -- Bad
```

-   Write function definitions of the form `function foo()` instead of the lambda form `foo = function()`, except when inserting functions in tables inline, where only the second form will work.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Avoid globals like the plague.** The only globals that you should create are namespace tables---and even those might eventually be phased out.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Don\'t let functions get too large. Maximum length depends on complexity; simple functions can be longer than complex functions.
