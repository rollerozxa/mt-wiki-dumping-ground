== Installing a dev version ==

=== Uploading an AppImage using Deck DevKit ===

Source: https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/loadgames

* Name: MinetestAppImage
* Local folder: <code>/home/user/dev/tmp/minetestdeck/</code>
* Upload filtering [Include only] <code>Minetest-dev.AppImage</code>
* Start command: <code>Minetest-dev.AppImage</code>
* Save config
* Click Upload
* On deck: <code>cp /usr/lib/libcrypto.so ~/devkit-game/MinetestAppImage/libcrypto.so.1</code>
* Minetest should now be in Non-steam games as "Devkit games: MinetestAppImage"

Note, I had issues reusing the layout from the stable version of the game. Pressing "apply layout" did nothing. I needed to follow this bizarre workaround https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/10tsp1a/i_cant_change_the_default_controller_layout/
