<p><br />
<b>IFS (IhrFussel's Server)</b> is an MMO-esque survival server with lots of MMO elements such as leveling, quests and events. The server runs on a dedicated machine and it is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week unless a backup, update or critical error happens. The server offers more than 160 different mods but it is ensured that you could join on any device as long as your device RAM is at least 600MB as many mods are simplified to give stability, so there is definitely something for everyone!
</p><p>This page is created with permission from the server owner, permission granted on 11 December 2017, 3:10PM of server time (Central European Time Zone). If you're wondering on the texturepack used on this server, it is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=9314">Summerfields</a>. You're encouraged to read the news by sending <code>/changelog</code> in-game from time to time, this is so that you're aware what's happening on the server.

</p><p>If you need help on something, you could send <code>/helpme</code> in chat and staffs who are online at the time would come to help you if they are not too busy. If you just want to ask something, you don't need to send the command first, just ask it directly in chat. If it's an emergency (for example, you're dying in-game), you could send <code>/sos</code> and it will quickly teleport any online staff to your position to save you.
</p><p>A normal player would usually have their name in white. However, anyone's colour would change to dark red when their health points are decreasing (eg. when they're dying or attacked) or green when their health points are increasing (eg. recovering their health).
</p><p>Just like any other server, <i>do not ask to be a moderator</i>. When the server admin feels you could be a moderator, you will be put to train as helper for some times to see if you fit to be moderator. You could see your chance to be a helper by sending <code>/helper</code> in the chat, it will also show you what you should do to improve your chance to be a helper. You need to be very active to be a helper, and you can't break any rules.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Rules">Rules</span></h2>
<ol><li>Respect each other and do not use bad language.</li>
<li>Do NOT harass,spam,impersonate,boss,lie,cause drama,abuse commands,use CAPS excessively.</li>
<li>NO griefing and usage of hacked clients.</li>
<li>You must NOT talk publicly nor build projects about sex, politics, drugs, racism and religions.</li>
<li>You are only allowed to have 1 active account on this server.</li>
<li>Helpers/Moderators who abuse their powers will lose their status immediately.</li>
<li>The admin and his moderators keep the right to modify ANY protected area if necessary.</li>
<li>Every player has the right to be free on the map and to be alone in their protected areas.</li>
<li>We forbid you to access a protected locked area WITHOUT permission of the owner.</li>
<li>Do not waste a helper's/moderator's/admin's time for no reason.</li></ol>
<p>This list of rules could be seen in game by sending <code>/rules</code> command.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Chat">Chat</span></h2>
<p>There are multiple chat channels on the server. When you're talking in one channel, people in other channel would not see your chat. However, the admin and moderator could read your chat in case someone reports your behaviour so don't break chat rules while you're in channels different from the channel the admin and moderator is talking in. By default, you will be chatting in the <code>main</code> channel. You can join any channel by sending <code>/join CHANNELNAME</code> where <code>CHANNELNAME</code> is either one of the following:
</p>
<ul><li><code>main</code>&#160;: The main and default channel where everyone is chatting</li>
<li><code>roleplay</code>&#160;: The only channel you're allowed to roleplay, <i>do not roleplay in other channel or you'll get bad score</i></li>
<li><code>games</code>&#160;: The channel to play text-based games, counting down to hide-and-seek, and to discuss games.</li>
<li><code>love</code>&#160;: The channel for players who are confessing their loves.</li>
<li><code>notalk</code>&#160;: The quiet channel, suitable when you want to record gameplay.</li></ul>
<p>The server features an auto translation that recognizes and translates many languages into English in real time. You could also use the translation command <code>/tr in out Text</code> where <code>in</code> should be replaced by the language code of the language you're writing, <code>out</code> should be replaced by the language code of the language you want to be translated and <code>Text</code> is the text or sentence you want it to translate.
</p><p>For example, if you want to translate "good morning" (English word) to Japanese then you would send the command <code>/tr en ja Good morning</code> where <code>en</code> is the language code of English, <code>ja</code> is the language code of Japanese and <code>Good morning</code> is the text you want to translate. Everyone would now sees <code>[Server]: &lt;your name&gt; requests a translation (en -&gt; ja) for "Good morning": おはようございます</code>.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Moving_Around">Moving Around</span></h2>
<p>From the spawn, there is a travelnet center not far from the spawn point. You could choose to go anywhere from the travelnet center including to the officially listed cities, and you're free to build on any unprotected land. You could also ask the city owner if they want to allow you build in their land, but in addition to server's rules, you'll also need to follow the city's rules. You will see the land's name and its owner name on the bottom left side of your screen if you're standing in a protected area. When you're in unprotected area, please protect your area by standing at the lowest point and send <code>/p1</code> in chat, then go to the diagonal opposite side, standing at the highest point and send <code>/p2</code> in chat, finishing it with sending <code>/protect NAME</code> where <code>NAME</code> is the name of your land.
</p><p>While you could go to the officially listed cities from the travelnet, you could also remember the name or city number and just say the city name or say L followed by its number in chat to be teleported there. The officially listed cities could be viewed by sending <code>/locations</code> in chat. There is also a city index building on the North Road, not far from the spawn, where you could use to go to older cities not available in the official city list.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="PVP">PVP</span></h2>
<p>PvP is set per-player, by default it is off. To enable it, make sure you and your PvP partner send <code>/pvpon</code> in the chat before you do PvP. After you're done, don't forget to disable PvP by sending <code>/pvpoff</code> in the chat, or else you could be killed by others. We also have PvP Arena and Battle Arena if you don't want to do PvP at your home.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Lucky_Blocks">Lucky Blocks</span></h2>
<p>You could get lucky blocks by saying LB in chat or sending <code>/luckyblocks</code> in chat, then you need to wait at least 5 minutes before requesting another stack of lucky blocks. You could go to Lucky Block Area by saying LBA in chat or by using either the server teleport or city index building. Please be aware that lucky blocks can only be placed inside the Lucky Blocks Area to prevent any damage to the rest of the map. Also, selling lucky blocks are illegal on the server.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Known_Transport">Known Transport</span></h2>
<p>There are cars and carts on the server. You could send <code>/cars TYPE</code> to get some cars where <code>TYPE</code> should be replaced by the type of car you want. Usually the types are colours but we do have different type of cars such as the nyancat car. There are carts on the server too, buy or craft the carts to use them.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Roads">Roads</span></h3>
<p>There are four roads from the spawn, namely North Road, West Road, North-West Road and South Road. The North Road is the most populated road and spawned so many housing areas, with multiple roads to a few cities and other locations. The server travelnet center, city index building and tree park are situated on North Road. The North-West Road is not too populated as it is snowy area, but there is a very beautiful and huge gateway on it. The West Road is populated with old player's building which has been there before the new spawn was built. The South Road is mostly inside the spawn area, a few mansions, a player's farm, the PvP Arena and the public farm are situated on the South Road. There are plans to extend the South Road.
</p><p>A few other notable roads includes the Boukennomichi Road &amp; Tunnel which connects from Little Japan to Papyville, MelonCity, LJ Iceland, North Road, Iconic City and Modern City; Fairdale Road which connects from North Road to Fairdale and the apartment area; Mori Road which connects Little Japan to PandaCity and Boomcity; Sky Road which connects from Little Japan to camskycity; West Road 2 which connects North Road to North-West Road passing a few mansions; Iconic Road which connects North Road to Iconic City and Modern City; and a few housing roads connected directly to the North Road such as Lana Road, KenKaneki Road, Dasa Road, High Street, etc.
</p><p>Most of the roads on the server ranges from 3-blocks to 9-blocks wide, depending on the purpose of the road. The original four roads from the spawn were built 3-blocks wide as they were intended for pedestrians use but some players do drive their car on those roads.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rails">Rails</span></h3>
<p>There are two main rail lines where you could use to move around.
</p><p>1. Neon's subway&#160;: it is a replica of modern subway station with tunnels connecting the stations. There might be plan to lay real tracks but for now it provides teleport pads on every station, or you could just walk in the tunnels. This rail line connects: Spawn - Phoenix Kingdom - JustCity - GreatCity - ModCity Mine - ModCity - JadeCity - Neon's Home
</p><p>2. Boukennomichi line&#160;: it is a fully working double track railway running underground on most part and elevated on the rest, hop on carts to use the rail. This train line was build in addition to the Boukennomichi Road &amp; Tunnel because some players are tired with driving cars on the very long road. It will not be extended anymore but additional line might be build to support other areas by connecting to this line. This rail line connects: camskycity - Little Japan Central - Papyville - MelonCity - Fairdale - LJ Iceland - North Road - Iconic City - Modern City
</p><p>There used to be IhrFussel's skyline build by IhrFussel up above the sky running parallel with North Road and contains two stations, Spawn and North Road where you could change to Boukennomichi line. However, the rail line was closed because too many players fall down and dead. A new underground rail line is being build by moderator muhdnurhidayat to replace this skyline, it will serve the same purpose of the skyline except that it will be safer to use.
</p><p>Aside these rail lines, there are other local rail lines in some cities where you could use to navigate the city (eg. in Little Japan, Modern City, JeanLand) plus there are a few roller coaster on North Road and amusement parks build by players.
